### The experimental repository. Please don't use it.

Deltotum is an experimental 2D-engine with GUI toolkit written in D from scratch.

The main goal is to get a comfortable, powerful and flexible graphics engine for personal projects, graphic experiments and tech blogging.

As of now, the API is extremely unstable and contains a lot of draft code.
