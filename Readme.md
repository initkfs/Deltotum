### The experimental repository. Please don't use it.

Deltotum is an experimental 2D engine written in D from scratch.

The project is in the early stages of experimentation and the api is extremely unstable.

WARNING! This project is for personal purposes only. The main goal is to get a comfortable, powerful and flexible GUI-toolkit for personal projects and graphic experiments. After reaching these goals, development will slow down.
